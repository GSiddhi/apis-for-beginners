## What is a REST API?

A REST API works like a **waiter between your application and the server**.

- Your application sends a request
- The API delivers the request to the server
- The server processes it
- The API sends the response back

REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**.
It is a standard way for applications to exchange data.
