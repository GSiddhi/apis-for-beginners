# APIs for Beginners

This repository is a beginner-friendly guide to understanding APIs
through simple explanations and practical examples.

The goal of this repo is to help you understand **how APIs work in real
applications**, without heavy theory or complex setups.

---

## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for one application
to communicate with another.

Instead of building everything from scratch, applications use APIs
to request data or functionality from other systems.

For example:
- a weather app uses an API to get weather data
- a payment app uses an API to process payments
- a social media app uses APIs to fetch posts and user profiles

You don’t need to know how the other system works internally.
You only need to know:
- how to send a request
- how to receive a response

If you have ever used an app or a website, you have already used APIs.

This repository focuses on helping you understand **how that communication works**.

---

## Who is this for?

This repository is for:
- beginners learning APIs for the first time
- students exploring backend or full-stack development
- anyone confused by terms like REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, Webhooks, or WebSockets
- developers who want a clear, practical reference

No prior API knowledge is required.

---

## What you will learn

By going through this repository, you will learn:
- what APIs are and why they exist
- different types of APIs and how they differ
- how API requests and responses look
- how applications communicate using APIs
- how to run simple, real API examples

## API Types Explained

Each API type is explained in simple language with examples.
Click any link below to read the explanation.

- [REST API](api-types/rest-api.md)
- [SOAP API](api-types/soap-api.md)
- [GraphQL API](api-types/graphql-api.md)
- [gRPC API](api-types/grpc-api.md)
- [Webhooks](api-types/webhooks-api.md)
- [WebSockets](api-types/websockets-api.md)
- [WebRTC](api-types/webrtc-api.md)

---

## Examples

This repository also includes **runnable examples** to show how APIs look in real code.

You can find all examples in the [`examples/`](examples/) folder.

Execution instructions for each example are available here:
- [How to run the examples](examples/README.md)

Examples included:
- [REST API](api-types/rest-api-example.md) (Python)
- [SOAP API](api-types/soap-api-example.md) (Python)
- [GraphQL API](api-types/graphql-api-example.md) (Python)
- [gRPC API](api-types/grpc-api-example.md) (Python – structure-focused)
- [Webhooks](api-types/webhooks-api-example.md) (Python server)
- [WebSockets](api-types/websockets-api-example.md) (Python server & client)
- [WebRTC](api-types/webrtc-api-example.md) (Browser-based HTML example)

## How to use this repository

1. Start by reading **What is an API?** above
2. Go through the API explanations in the [`api-types/`](api-types/) folder
3. Explore the example files in the [`examples/`](examples/) folder
4. Run the examples and experiment with the code
5. Take your time — APIs make more sense with practice

---

## Important Notes

- Some examples use public demo services, which may occasionally be unavailable
- gRPC and SOAP examples focus on structure and flow rather than production setups

---

## Final Note

APIs can feel overwhelming at first, but they are simply ways for
applications to communicate with each other.

This repository exists to make that communication feel less confusing
and more approachable.

Happy learning!!!
